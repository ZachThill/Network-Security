#Disabling SMBv1/SMBv2/SMBv3 from Windows servers 



What is SMB? 
- SMB, or (Server Message Block protocol) is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications on a computer to read and write to files and to request services 
  from server programs in a computer network. Not only does SMB allow computers to share files, but it also enables computers to share printers and even serial ports 
  from other computers within the network.  
  
  History of SMB 
 - In 2017, the imfanous WannaCry Ransomware was a exploit for SMB version 1 that infected hundreds of thousands of devices and encrypted their data. In order
   for companies to get their data back, they had to pay a ransom in Bitcoin. As a server admin, make sure to disable SMBv1 and SMBv2 as they are not the latest version.
   SMBv3 is the latest and most secure version of SMB and currently, there are no known vulnerabilities reported or exploited.
