# Implementing Honeypots 

# Whis is A Honeypot? 
 - A honeypot is a computer or computer system intended to mimic likely targets of cyberattacks. It can be used to detect attacks or deflect them from a legitimate target. It can also be used to gain information about how cybercriminals operate.

# Why Bother? 
 - When thinking about the basics of Hacking, threat actors are activley trying to gain unrestriced access to your network and launch their payload to compramise any 
 server / workstation they can. With this said, honeypots are a great way to lure potential threat actors into attacking servers on ahoneynet that isn't truly apart of your private network. These honeypots will essentially slow Red Team down and buy yourself time to harden the netowrk even more. In addition to this, honeypots are a great way log, block, and report any suspicious behavior.
