# Implementing Port Spoofing 
**Authored by Zachary Thill - Student Project Leader @ RRCC**

# What is Port Spoofing? 
 - Port spoofing is a network spoof that relies on usage of non standard network TCP/UDP ports. There are lots of variations and details, but the basic idea is an 
   attacker attempts to bypass perimeter safeguards by directing network traffic with malicious intent using non-standard (unexpected) ports. 
   
# Why Bother? 
- When thinking back to the basics of Hacking, it's all about the reconnaissance. At the beginning of every Cyber Attack, Hackers will scan ports in order to see what
  traffic we are letting through and where. With Port Spoofing, we can pro-long and make port scanning a living nightmare for even the smartest threat actor. Giving
  them a heaping pile of bad information that leads nowhere will buy any Blue Team enough time to harden their systems and establich a netowrk presence.
